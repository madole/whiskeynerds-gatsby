###About the Distillery
Built in 1897 and currently the highest distillery in the country, Dalwhinnie – or “Plain of Meetings” in Gaelic – is named for its location at a junction of old drove roads, between two mountain ranges. Year after year it survives the coldest of conditions to produce smooth, golden heather honey-like spirit.

###Our Take

**Sight:**
A lovely bottle holds an interesting light golden whiskey with a greenish hue. 
The 95 rating on Jim’s bible has given us great expectations.

**Aroma:** 
The aroma is delicious. Sweet, not boozy and it lingers in the nose. Maple tones, fruity.

**Flavour:** 
A delightful fruity sweetness that lingers in the back of the palate. Barely any peat. Smooth. Warm. Soft and nurturing. 

**Finish:** 
True to the original aroma, the finish is also sweet. Not very complex but really sticky. 

All in all a very kind whiskey. Enjoyable and easy to drink.
Great for the drinkers that don't really enjoy the smokey ones.
