###From the Distiller
This single grain whisky was made with diverse unblended whisky brewing techniques and master craftsmanship developed over many years at the Chita Distillery in Aichi Prefecture. It features a light taste and delicately sweet fragrance.

The design features black calligraphy that expresses the distinctive qualities of Japanese whisky set on a white Japanese washi paper label representing the light flavor.

###Our Take

**Sight:**
Suntory’s name carries a reputation. Initially we tried to figure out which grain it’s made of because there's a little icon in the bottle that looks like a corncob. The whiskey is very light colored.

**Aroma:** 
Initially boozy but it lightens up to reveal a deeper aroma after left breathing for a few minutes, still on the gentle side of the scope. No smoke. Fruity. Vanilla.

**Flavour:** 
Sweet and clean on the palate. Incredibly smooth. Very easy to drink. Not a lot of complexity. Soft and nice.

**Finish:** 
Flat and short. Not too much to tell.

Overall a nice and gentle dram. Something very typical of Japanese whiskeys. Subtle.
