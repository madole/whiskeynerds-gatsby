**Varietal**: Australian Peated | **Style**: Single Malt | **Alcohol**: 46.2%

***Tasting Note***:
The nose elicits a smoky, malted scent mixed with apple, vanilla and spices.  The taste is full-bodied and exquisitely balanced to deliver a delightful apple and spice combination over a smoky ambience.

####Our Rating
**Smell:** 3.75/5 | **Taste:** 3.5/5 | **Smoothness:** 2.5/5   
**Overall:** 3.25/5 

*Comments:* Quite a powerful alcoholic aroma mixed with a peat fire. Easy on the palate, burn on the esophagus, great aftertaste. Needs a drop of water to open it and get over the initial kick in the face attitude. It's not a breakfast whiskey.
