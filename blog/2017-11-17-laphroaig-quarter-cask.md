###About the Distiller
Laphroaig distillery (/ləˈfrɔɪɡ/ (About this sound listen) lə-FROYG) is an Islay single malt Scotch whisky distillery. It is named for the area of land at the head of Loch Laphroaig on the south coast of the Isle of Islay. The meaning of the toponym is unknown, but a commonly suggested etymology includes the elements "lag" (Gaelic: hollow), "breid" (Norse: broad) and "vik" (Norse: bay), implying an original Gaelic form something like "Lag Bhròdhaig" (the hollow of Broadbay). The name may be related to a placename on the east coast of Islay, "Pròaig", again suggested as meaning "broad bay". The distillery and brand are owned and operated by Beam Suntory, the American subsidiary of Japan's Suntory Holdings.

The Laphroaig distillery was established in 1815 by Donald and Alexander Johnston. The Johnstons who founded Laphroaig were from the Clan Donald and are likely to be from the MacIain of Ardnamurchan branch of the clan. The family anglicised their name to Johnston. The last member of the Johnston family to run the distillery was Ian Hunter, a nephew of Sandy Johnston, who died childless in 1954 and left the distillery to one of his managers, Bessie Williamson.

The distillery was sold to Long John International in the 1960s, and subsequently became part of Allied Domecq. The brand was in turn acquired by Fortune Brands in 2005, as one of the brands divested by Pernod Ricard in order to obtain regulatory approval for its takeover of Allied Domecq. Fortune Brands then split up its business product lines in 2011, forming its spirits business into Beam Inc. Beam was then purchased by Suntory Holdings in April 2014.

Laphroaig has been the only whisky to carry the Royal Warrant of the Prince of Wales, which was awarded in person during a visit to the distillery in 1994. The distillery identifies Charles by his title of Duke of Rothesay, as he is recognised in Scotland. The 15-year-old was reportedly the prince's favourite Scotch whisky.

###Our Take

**Sight:**
It presents itself in the traditional Laphroaig green bottle that we've come to know and love. Pours a lovely gold.

**Aroma:** 
As soon as it's pouring the aroma holds no punches. The smell is bold and the peat is extreme. Like a bonfire. It lingers throughout the tasting. Very intense.

**Flavour:** 
It continues to deliver the peat the aroma promised. Full smoke while incredibly smooth. It's one of the peatiest whiskeys we have tasted to date. Flavour that lasts for days. An all expenses paid journey to whiskey town. Amazing.

**Finish:** 
The charcoal lingers like embers. It never leaves you. A smoke lover's paradise. wood fire in a campground. Extremely long finish.

**Thoughts:**
We were told to expect a world of peat and it didn't disappoint. 
An excellent dram. If you love your whiskeys smokey look no more. This is the holy grail.
