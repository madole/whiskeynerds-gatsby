###About the Distiller



Lagavulin distillery is an Islay single malt Scotch whisky distillery in Lagavulin on the island of Islay, Scotland.

The standard Lagavulin single malt is 16 years old (43%), though they regularly release a 12-year-old cask strength variety, a Distiller's edition finished in Pedro Xim√©nez casks, and 25- and 30-year-old varieties.

Lagavulin is produced by United Distillers & Vintners, which in turn is owned by Diageo plc. It is marketed under their Classic Malts brand.

The name Lagavulin is an anglicisation of Lag a' Mhuilinn, Scottish Gaelic for hollow of the mill. [Source: Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagavulin_distillery)

###Our Take

**Sight:**
The packaging and 16 year age statement is promising!
Stunning classy bottle.  Long legs and a dark colour.

**Aroma:** 
Strong peat aroma.  Smokey but not overwhelming the whiskey.

**Flavour:** 
Very smooth, one of my favorites.  Its dry and not too peaty.  A little smokey, a little sweet.

**Finish:** 
Doesn't have a harsh end surprisingly.  Its tasty with a light balance.  Sweet.  Its so smooth it's like it's not there!

**Thoughts:**
Yeah its a good proper WHISKY. doesn't penalise you harshly and easily drinkable
