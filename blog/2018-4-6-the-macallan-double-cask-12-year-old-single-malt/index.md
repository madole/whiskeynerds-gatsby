###About the Distiller

The Macallan distillery is a single malt Scotch whisky distillery in Craigellachie, Moray. The Macallan Distillers Ltd, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Edrington Group which purchased the brand from Highland Distillers in 1999.[1]

In 2009, The Herald reported that Macallan was "the worldâ€™s third largest-selling single malt (behind Glenfiddich and Glenlivet) with over 500,000 cases a year, and second largest by value".[2] The Scotsman published a quote from Ken Grier on 16 August 2009, stating: "We have now overcome Glenfiddich to move into the second biggest selling single malt by volume behind Glenlivet".[3] In 2011, Edrington Group reported that prior-year sales of The Macallan were up 8% to over 700,000 cases and the BBC also reported that an office was being opened in New York to continue growth in the American market.[4]

Originally, The Macallan was matured only in oak sherry casks brought to the distillery from Jerez, Spain. Beginning in 2004, The Macallan introduced a new main product, the Fine Oak series, with the whisky mellowed in bourbon oak casks as well as sherry ones.

###Our Take

**Sight:**
The packaging doesnt make it stand out above other whisky. Very light colour gives the impression that its light.
Surprisingly plain looking whisky
Light gold in colour
It has The colour of whiskey. There was a bottle of whiskey above it at the shop for $9999 so I assume this is just as good

**Aroma:** 
Not much smell, not peaty. Smells like a johnny red :)
Smells pleasant
Caramel notes, toffee kick. Sweet but Smokey

**Flavour:** 
Very smooth and balanced tasting whisky. Very easy to drink. Doesnt bite after each sip. Really enjoyable
Strong and Smokey
Smooth and tasty

**Finish:** 
Yeah, great drink all around
Soft finish
Finishes quick

For a bottle bought at the last minute, pretty damn good
Pretty good!
