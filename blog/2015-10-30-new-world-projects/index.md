The contrasting elements of these first & second fill, 200 litre barrels are seamlessly integrated in a style somewhat less boisterous than the previous innovators behind NWWD.

*New World Projects are a division of Starward whisky.*

**Comments:**

Fruity, crisp, citrusy, peachy, smell up front with a woody taste lingering in the glass after the whisky has be consumed.  

Pointy taste at first as you get used to the alcohol content, this subsides to let the flavour shine through in the following sips. A fantastic lingering aftertaste appears when opened up with a few drops of water. 

An impressive light golden colour in comparison to the Talisker Port Ruighe, another port cask whisky, which has a much deeper red colour.
