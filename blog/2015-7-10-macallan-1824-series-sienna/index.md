The Macallan 1824 Series focuses on single malts that are of exemplary colour and flavour with a range of casks and liquid ages (no age statement) used to deliver the desired colour and exceptional Macallan character. The 'Sienna', exclusively matured in sherry oaks casks, brings subtle notes of vanilla, zest and fresh green apples. The palate opens up with dates, figs and raisins which then defer to nutmeg and ginger before the vanilla returns, tying it all together. The final fanfare is a gentle, smooth and warming finish.

**Varietal:** Scotch | **Style:** Single Malt | **Alcohol:** 43.0%

### Our Rating

**Taste:** 4/5 | **Smell:** 2.5/5 | **Smoothness:** 4.5/5  
**Overall:** 4/5

_Comments:_ Very smooth on the tongue at the first sip, but then you feel a slight burn after you swallow. A really easy whiskey to drink on its own.
