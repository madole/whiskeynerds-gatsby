Magnificently muscular. Most heavily peated malts are so dry and phenolic there is little else to spark the senses, not so this young warrior who arouses pride and passion, transporting you to that most famous rock in the Atlantic ocean – Islay – the beating heart of the Hebrides. 

**Varietal:** Scotch | 
**Style:** Single Malt | 
**Age:** 5 Year Old |
**Alcohol:** 57.0%

####Our rating:

**_Taste:_** 3.5/5  | **_Smell:_** 4/5 | **_Smoothness:_** 3/5

**_Overall:_** 3.5/5

_Comments:_ This is the most heavily peated whiskey in the world ever. It smells great, but its' taste is quite extreme. We definitely recommended you try it even just to smell the extremely peated aroma.
