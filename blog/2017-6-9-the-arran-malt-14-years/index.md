###From the Distiller
Arran has always been a fine place to make good whisky, but when quantity was prized over quality our wee island couldn’t compete economically, and one by one the distilleries fell into disuse.  We revived the tradition when we built our new distillery in Lochranza, at the north end of the island. When a three-year old cask was opened on 25th July 1998, our guests enjoyed the first legal dram of Arran whisky in over 160 years.

We now produce a range of ages and expressions, but all are made using the same traditional methods and materials. We always use all-Scottish barley and the washbacks - large wooden vessels used for fermentation - are crafted from Oregon pine. Distillation takes place in tall, swan-necked copper stills and our whisky matures in carefully-chosen oak casks that have previously held Sherry, Bourbon and other noble liquors. Even today, about 2% of the spirit escapes through the porous wood each year, providing the angels with their famous share….

###Our Take
With a very young colour this crisp slow burner whiskey has little peat but great depth. Which is enhanced by a nice soft long finish.

We found our experience gradually increasing from the aroma to the taste to the finish.
