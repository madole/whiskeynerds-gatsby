**FROM THEIR SITE**

In our first groundbreaking experiment, Malt Master Brian Kinsman has proven that traditional whisky casks can still be seasoned in a pioneering way. Collaborating with a local Speyside craft brewer, Brian created a bold and zesty IPA beer to imbue our rich oak casks with extra hoppy notes. The experiment resulted in the first single malt Scotch whisky ever finished in craft IPA casks. 

Finished in bespoke craft IPA barrels, our pioneering new malt is imbued with unique zesty citrus notes and the subtle tang of fresh hops. The flavour comes with carefully hand selecting the right malt whiskies to complement the extra hoppy notes. http://www.glenfiddich.com/au/explore/experimental-ipa

**COLOUR**: Bright Gold

**NOSE**: At bottling strength, a soft toffee sweet but faintly spicy flavour counterbalances the trace of delicate phenols and fruit. An all encompassing smoothness brings these together. A touch of water allows the seaweed and salt to come through but not enough to overpower the vanilla and honey sweetness with just a trace of new mown hay and peat at the finish.

**BODY**: An intense depth that is exceptionally balanced and warming.

**PALATE**: An instant warming tang of smoke fades into smooth floral scents, which blends seamlessly into an oaky nuttiness and leaves a lasting sweetness on the taste. With a touch of water, the peaty warmth fills the mouth but does not overshadow the sweet chocolate smoothness. This is balanced by the rich toffee taste and slowly fades into a delicate hint of heather and peat smoke.

**FINISH**: Full bodied, long with a luxurious oily smoothness.
