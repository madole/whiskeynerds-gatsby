>A classic never-ending, rich, and enticing combination of classic Ardbeggian notes and incredibly creamy flavours. 

This limited edition whisky from Ardbeg is one of a range of what they call "Distinct (Yet Now Extinct) Drink". There exists a sister whisky *committee edition* from the same year weighing in at a heavier 49.2% alcohol content compared to the limited edition which is 47.4%.
 
This particular single malt is to commemorate 200 years of the Ardbeg distillery. It boasts the phrase "Here's to the next 200 years" on the label.

###Tasting notes from Ardbeg

**Colour:** Deep Amber

**Nose:** Tar, soot and pine resin leads to dark chocolate, treacle toffee, and a distant, nutty/oaky note. Water initiates fresh, briny sea-spray, linseed oil, and a pine resin/lime top note. Remarkably fresh for such a peaty whisky.

**Taste:** Intense, robust peat smoke, savoury smoky bacon, cinnamon and nutmeg, but also an incredible creamy, sweet vanilla/milk chocolate note.

**Finish:** The never-ending aftertaste sees more linseed oil (a hint of the Sherry Casks), creosote and tar, but understated, always gentle.

Ardbeg claims this whisky has a deep amber colour, but we've found it to be a really light golden colour. When you uncork the bottle, the room fills with the classic Ardbeg peaty aroma.

### Overall
This whisky is all about the nose. Its got deep notes of spicy peat. 
It does split the crowd though, it's a bit overpowering for some people. Not for the faint hearted. 
Don't let it's light colour fool you into thinking there is a lack of taste with this one. If you like peated whiskies, this is a great option for your whisky collection.
