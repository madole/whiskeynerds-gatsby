###About the Distillery
Amrut Distilleries Ltd is an Indian company that produces distilled beverages. It is best known for its eponymous Amrut brand of single malt whisky, which is the first single malt whisky to be made in India. The brand became famous after world famous whisky connoisseur Jim Murray gave it a rating of 82 out of 100 in 2005 and 2010. In 2010, Murray named Amrut Fusion single malt whisky as the third best in the world. John Hansell, editor of American magazine Whisky Advocate, wrote that "India's Amrut distillery changed the way many think of Indian whisky - that it was, in the past, just cheap Scotch whisky blended with who knows what and sold as Indian whisky. Amrut is making whisky, and it's very good".

Despite the fame the company has received for the single malt whisky, it accounted for only 4-5% of the company's revenue in 2011-12. The bulk of its revenue comes from the sales of brandy, rum, vodka, gin and blended whisky, particularly the Silver Oak brandy, Old Port rum and Prestige whisky brands. Approximately 20% of its revenue comes from supplying the Canteen Stores Department. Amrut Distilleries currently sells Amrut single malt whisky in 23 countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States

###Our Take
Our very first Indian Whiskey and, being completely honest, the expectations were low but we were soon to be dramatically shattered.

One of the darkest whiskeys we've seen, with a bold aroma and full flavour. 
Incredibly smooth for a 61.8% whiskey. It is in fact one of the most alcoholic whiskeys we've had, yet we found it sweet and comforting. The caramel and butterscotch is apparent.

Perfect for the winter. Keep some in your hip flask of choice when in the snow or when climbing Everest.

Warms the cockles before heading to a football match.

And even after activation it retains a luscious flavour.

"Stokes the fire of your heart"

It's no wonder Jimâ€™s Whiskey Bible rates it so high.

Truly delightful.

An excellent gift for anyone who's never ventured outside the ranges of Scotland, Ireland and Japan. Shatter your prejudices.
