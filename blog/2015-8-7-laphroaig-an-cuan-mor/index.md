Translated as Big Ocean, this unique expression is a celebration of the art of Laphroaig, with only the best batches hand selected by our distillery manager for their exceptional flavour. All have been matured in first-fill-only ex-American white oak bourbon barrels in our warehouse right next to the Atlantic. This whisky is then carefully re-casked and left to sleep in the finest European oak. The result is an extraordinary fusion of flavours, from our unmistakable medicinal peat, to the soft and spicy caramel tones of the American wood, to the big, rich “burnt apricot and raisin” of the European oak. Finally bottled and non chill-filtered, the distillery manager’s selected batches are marked with his signature. Anything that can withstand the Atlantic for 200 years deserves a little recognition.
