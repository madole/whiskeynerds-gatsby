A'bunadh is a cask-strength single malt whisky from the Aberlour Distillery in Scotland. Though it has no age statement, it is released in limited run batches, each batch carrying a unique number on its label. Each batch of this whisky is blended from barrels ranging from 5 to 25 years old.

A'bunadh is exclusively aged in Spanish oak Oloroso sherry butts and therefore has a sweeter, softer flavor than most scotch. A'bunadh is not chill filtered.

The word a'bunadh is translated into English from Scottish Gaelic as (of) the origin.

Comments: This whisky has a serious burn factor but surprisingly still tastes great. Like a chilli burn, it burns in your mouth but doesn't follow it's way down and it's short lived so the taste comes through pretty quickly. We found it to be much more enjoyable with a few drops of water just to calm down that initial burn.
