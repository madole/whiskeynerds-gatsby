###From their site
We’re not sure if our Head Blender, Billy Leighton, has a musical note in his head but harmony is his main pursuit. The Blender’s Dog is a whiskey that celebrates his craft the art of marrying whiskeys. A superbly balanced, complex whiskey, The Blender’s Dog is a perfect balance of spirit, wood, and time; delivering butterscotch sweetness with a prickle of spice and tannins. Making whiskey requires a fair deal of science, but blending is an art.

‘I wanted to create harmony and complexity, an infusion of flavour that perfectly fills your mouth and nose. My whiskey has a rich creamy mouth feel, with the sweetness of butterscotch, giving way to the prickle of spices and tannins’. - Billy Leighton, Head Blender.
