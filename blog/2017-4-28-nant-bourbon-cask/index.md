###About the Distillery
In 2012, just four years after beginning commercial production, Nant Single Malt Whisky was catapulted to global renown when Jim Murray, the world’s foremost whisky commentator, scored Nant Single Malt Whisky – American Oak Bourbon Wood 95.5 out of 100. This rarest of scores saw Nant rated among the top 50 whiskies in the world.

‘Nant’, meaning ‘stream’, was the name given by the first Welsh settlers to both the Valley and the Estate. This very stream meanders through Nant Estate and flows into the millpond; that powers the wheel that turns the stones that grist the malted barley – that also gives its name to Australia’s only Highland Single Malt Whisky.

Both a source of power and a key ingredient in Nant’s success, these pristine waters trace their source upstream to the river Clyde, which is fed from a million-year-old glacial lake in the mystical Tasmanian Highlands.

###Our Take
Expectations were high for this "pricey" 500ml bottle. 

Tasmanian distilleries have been in the international spotlight a few times but Australia hasn't yet attained the reputation in quality and consistency that other "non-traditional" Whiskey producing countries like Japan have, so it's understood that the price tag is more a reflection of the rarity rather than the quality. But still, for $150+ you expect a solid product and here's what we found...

With a sweet aroma of ripe bananas, the hint of alcohol is barely noticeable, which is a pleasant surprise in such a clear young looking whiskey.

The first sip goes down cleanly. Incredibly smooth, and it's definitely delicious. But not for that price tag.

It has a medium finish but not incredibly strong. 

Recommended for collectors.
