<h2 class="center"> About the distillery</h2> 
> ####History
>The Longmorn Distillery Company was founded in 1893 by John Duff, Charles Shirres and George Thomson. Duff was a former manager of the Glendronach Distillery and the Bon Accord Distillery in Aberdeen, and was the founder of the Glenlossie Distillery, as well as being involved with unsuccessful distilleries in Cape Town and the USA.

>Longmorn Distillery started production in December 1894. Three years later John Duff built the Benriach Distillery next to Longmorn, but both were affected by the collapse of wholesale buyers Pattison, Elder and Co. in 1898. Duff was ruined by the collapse, and Longmorn Distilleries Company Ltd. passed through a variety of ownerships. In 1970, Longmorn joined The Glenlivet and Glen Grant to form The Glenlivet Distillers Ltd. This was bought by Chivas Brothers in 1978 and in 2001 Chivas Brothers was acquired by the French Pernod Ricard Group.

> ####The Taste
>Longmorn is considered to be the best kept Scotch Whisky secret by all. A pinnacle 16 year old single malt whisky that showcases the very best of this traditional Speyside malt, Longmorn has been producing whiskies for some of the most recognisable whisky names for centuries. Some even consider Longmorn to be the 'holy grail' of malts. Showing a nose of dusty spice, mocha and dried honey, the Longmorn 16 Year Old follows up on the palate with rich notes of toffee, cinnamon and nutmeg. The finish is long and pure and is best served neat or with a dash of pure still water.

### Comments
"A heavy salty aroma with a sharp sweetness, more toffee than caramel."

"The flavor surpassed the expectations set by the aroma, quite a nice surprise"

"It singed my nose but I'm a weak dog"

### Overall
We are surprised by the disparity between smell and flavor. It's still a tasty, easy to drink whiskey. Worth giving a shot if you are looking for something new.
