This subtle expression with a golden amber colour has notes of fine toasted cereal and apple, making this a full, fruity malt with a smooth and mellow finish.

**Taste:** 3/5 | **Smell:** 3/5 | **Smoothness:** 4/5  
**Overall:** 3.5/5

_Comments:_ A perfect whiskey to casually drink with a friend over the course of a night. Smooth and easy to drink.
