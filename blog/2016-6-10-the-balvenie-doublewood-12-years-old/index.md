---
A single malt scotch whisky distilled at The Balvenie distillery in Banffshire, Scotland. 

The Balvenie DoubleWood acquires its complex taste from its maturation in two different types of oak cask. 

>**Whiskey Oak**

>Many years of maturation in traditional whisky casks mellows the maturing spirit and imparts warming layers of vanilla spiciness

>**Sherry Oak** 

>Further maturation in European oak sherry casks increases complexity bringing fruity honeyed depths to the resulting single malt. 

<br />

>###About the distillery
The Balvenie distillery has been owned and managed by the same independent family company for five generations. Nowhere else will you find a distillery that still grows it's own barley, still malts in its own traditional floor maltings and still employs a team of coopers to tend to all the casks and a coppersmith to maintain the stills.
