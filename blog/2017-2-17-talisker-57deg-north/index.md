**FROM THEIR SITE**

Talisker 57° North takes its name from this remote, rugged and windswept distillery’s latitude. And rightly so, because this is an untamed, natural expression of the Talisker’s full power: a volcanic, intensely appealing flavour that most drinkers will have only experienced in a cask strength bottling.

**NOSE**: Clean and intense, with the light smoke of a struck match. Creamy toffee balanced by fruit. Hints of seaweed, heather blossom and vanilla.

**PALATE**: Sweet, with smoke and tar exploding around the middle - evoking the raw volcanic power which formed Skye’s famous Black Cuillin mountains.

**FINISH**: Oily, tingling with the signature pepperiness. Smoother with water.
