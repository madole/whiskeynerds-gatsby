###About the Whiskey
A recent addition to the lineup of British wine and spirit merchant *Berry Bros. & Rudd*, this is a creation of their in-house expert Doug McIvor. 

Matured for 10 years in American oak casks in Ireland, it's shipped and finished in Scotland after a few months in Laphroaig casks which result in that delicious peat.

No wonder the green glass bottle is identical to the one in Laphroaig's Triple Wood.

###Our Take
A young smooth whiskey with a clear colour and a soft initial aroma that doesn't give away the smokey surprise that embraces the palate from the first sip. This one is all about the flavour.

Surprisingly the smokiness doesn't result in a long finish.

This is a delicious and unique choice for those willing to step outside the big names and try something new.

We found it an excellent pairing with caramel popcorn.
