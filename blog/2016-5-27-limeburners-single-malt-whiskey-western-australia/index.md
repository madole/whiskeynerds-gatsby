Continuing our streak of firsts, we have our first Western Australian whisky! 

Aged in sherry casks and bottle 098 of a 300 bottle batch, we have high hopes for this. 

The presentation is great, a clear plastic box containing a fantastically shaped bottle. The colour is a light golden colour. Topped with an ominous screw on cap. 
 
###About the distillery

A boutique distillery producing premium quality single malt whisky using time honoured techniques and traditional copper pot stills. Each batch is produced and bottled by hand.

By world standards we are a tiny operation... which is the way they like it. 

>Our focus is on quality - quantity is irrelevant.
  

####What they say
Exhibiting spice and fruit aroma when neat, a splash of water unleashes malted barley, aromas of sherry and vanilla with hints of honey, raisins and buttery caramel. 

Medium coloured with intense and complex flavours, a full taste and a smooth finish.
