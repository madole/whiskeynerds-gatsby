###Our Take

**Sight:**
Golden-yellow, like a dark speyside
Twisty cap! Expectations lowered appropriately
V dark, fine bottle but plastic cap
Golden, straw

**Aroma:** 
Pencil wood, definitely.
Bold

**Flavour:** 
<*insert Fire emoji's!*> high burn for a 43%
Needs cooling off with some water or chilled glass. There is a bit of saltiness I like, as with speysides, but this is a real puncher!
Sweet and hard burn

**Finish:** 
Very peaty burnt for my taste
The finish is on the strong side for me, but I do like strong drinks. Might need to be paired with something.
Smooth and lingering

**Thoughts:**
My first American whiskey, I think. Need to try more before deciding. Won't be replacing my faves...
Harsher than expected
Not to my liking
