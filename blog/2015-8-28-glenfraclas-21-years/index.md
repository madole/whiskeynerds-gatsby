This single malt Whisky is the result of over 170 years of tradition and experience. Sweet malt and smoky peat wreath the gorgeous palate. An outstanding whisky.

**Varietal:** Scotch | **Style:** Single Malt | **Alcohol:** 43% | **Age:** 21 Years

**Smell:** 3.75/5 | **Taste:** 4/5 | **Smoothness:** 4/5 | 
**Overall:** 4/5

Comments: Smells like oats and gunpowder. A smooth and unique sweet flavor with a slight kick that diminishes with each sip. Delicious. And it comes in a box. (Thanks Paul)
