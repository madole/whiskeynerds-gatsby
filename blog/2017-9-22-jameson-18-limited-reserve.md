###About the Distillery
The John Jameson and Son Irish Whiskey company was formally established in 1810 when John Jameson and his son (also John Jameson) took ownership of the Bow Street Distillery in Dublin which had originally been built by his wife's cousins the Steins in 1780. Jameson was a Scottish lawyer from Alloa in Clackmannanshire who had married Margaret Haig, a sister of the Haig brothers who owned the Haig distilleries. Margaret Haig was a first cousin of the Steins, a Scottish distilling family, also from Clackmannanshire, with significant distilling interests in Scotland and Dublin. On his marriage to Margaret Haig in 1786, John Jameson moved with his new wife to Dublin to manage the Stein's Bow Street Distillery (which had been established in 1780) for Margaret's Stein uncle. This explains the use of the year 1780 in Jameson marketing as the Bow Street Distillery was where Jameson Irish Whiskey was born. Portraits of John and Margaret Jameson by Sir Henry Raeburn are in the collection of the National Gallery of Ireland.

Originally one of the six main Dublin Whiskeys, Jameson is now distilled in Cork. In 2013, annual sales topped 4.7 million cases (56.4 million bottles). Jameson is by far the best selling Irish whiskey in the world, as it has been sold internationally since the early 19th century. The United States is the largest market for Jameson Whiskey, with consumption during 2013 up by 12%.

####The Distiller on this Whiskey:
Matured for 18 years in hand-selected oak casks from Europe and America, this rare whiskey is finished in first-fill bourbon barrels. This rite of passage introduces subtle traces of vanilla to an exceptionally balanced, mellow whiskey with a lingering finale of wood, spice and toffee. An elder statesman of our portfolio, each bottle of this unique whiskey is individually numbered.

###Our Take
The elegant box set the expectations for this whiskey with a reputation that precedes it and it's world renowned.

It's a light golden colour that made us think of a much younger whiskey.
The aroma is crisp and sweet without being overwhelming. 

It goes down silky smooth, definitely one of the easiest whiskeys for anyone getting started. With a light, sweet and clean flavour, like fresh water with a slight and almost imperceptible peat at the end. 

The finish is medium but mild. 

This Jameson is almost too easy to drink. A very high quality blend but not incredibly complex or robust. This is the perfect whiskey to begin your journey in the whiskey world.
