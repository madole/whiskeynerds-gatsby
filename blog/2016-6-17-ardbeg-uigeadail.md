> "The ultimate islay scotch whiskey"

Ardbeg Uigeadail (pronounced Oog-a-dal) takes its name from the brooding, mysterious lock which provides the peat-laden water for ardbeg. This is a special vatting of different styles of ardbeg, marrying together its traditional deep, smokey notes with the luscious sweet raisiny tones of old ex-sherry casks. 

Uigeadail is non chill-filtered at high strength which retains maximum flavour and gives more body and added depth. 

A little cloudiness may occur when opened with water, this is perfectly natural.

### Comments
"Much prefer it opened up with water"

"Tingly on the tongue"

"I just love the smell"

"First sip is pretty harsh, but it really gets better over time until it ends up really really nice"

"Considering how heavy and peaty this is, it's quite smooth"

"Don't take this whisky at face value, the first sip is pretty heavy but you really settle into it"

"I'd call this a trend setter in the peated whisky market, it ticks all the right boxes" 

"This is a deceptively strong whisky, if I didn't know better, I'd say this was a 40% whisky rather than 54.2%"

### Overall
This is a really great whiskey. Very smokey, and impressively smooth for such a high alcohol content. 

This is a great sipping whiskey. I can see me drinking this by the fire on a cold winters evening.
