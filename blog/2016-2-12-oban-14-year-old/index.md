**Oban** *Little Bay of Caves*

>Along the shores of lorn lies a record of man. Far more ancient than that of any city in the land. The first settlers arrived on the mainland in 5,000BC and sheltered in the natural caves of the land, then known as *'an ob'*. The *'Distillery Cave'* was one of such shelter hidden in the creag a bharrain cliffs which rise dramatically above the **Oban Distillery**.
