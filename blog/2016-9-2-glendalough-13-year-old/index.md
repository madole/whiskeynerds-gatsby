This whiskey is the big brother of the [Double Barrel](http://whiskeynerds.com/glendalough-double-barrel/) which we reviewed a few months ago. 
When I was buying the Double Barrel, my contact at the whiskey emporium assured me that if I liked this one, the 13 year would be out of this world. The double barrel scored a high 4/5 which translates into 8/10 in our new scoring method.
I've tasted this weeks offering once before in a cool whiskey bar in Melbourne but I'm looking forward to giving it a proper tasting at our whiskey club.

>Glendalough Distillery is a young distillery set up by five friends from Wicklow and Dublin. It is one of few distilleries trying to revive the once booming distilling industry in Ireland.

>Their aim is to make innovative spirits while staying true to the tradition and heritage of their ancestors.

>They started with the classic Irish spirit poit√≠n (pronounced pot-cheen), before moving on to whiskey and most recently seasonal, wild botanical gins.

### Comments
"I can taste dark chocolate"

"A slightly bitter finish and a low volume taste"

"This whiskey has a slightly numbing effect on the tongue"

### Overall

This is a fine whiskey but if you're looking for the best value for money, I'd go for the cheaper option of the Glendalough Double Barrel, it encompasses everything that you expect from an Irish whiskey, creamy and smooth with great flavour.
