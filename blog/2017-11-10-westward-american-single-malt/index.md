###Our Take

**Sight:**
Extremely dark amber profile. Mysterious.

**Aroma:** 
Initially it smells like rum and coke. Sweet. Once it breathes it reveals a deeper aroma but the sweetness remains. Vanilla. Esters. A good solid malt with rum tones.

**Flavour:** 
The right kind of smoothness. Not overly gentle. Sweet and dry. Burnt Orange. Molasses. It eases out after the first sip. But the most distinct and recognizable feature is the bit of salt at the end. Very unique and not unpleasant.

**Finish:** 
Mid-length finish. Very Unique. Salty. Toffee. Rum like.

**Thoughts:**
Brought by one of our most serious drinkers and with great reviews to back it up. Naturally, expectations were high.

This is a great and bold sweet whiskey. Not overpowering in sweetness but with big presence. Something that will get any Rum drinker plenty of joy.
