King Harald was famed for his army, which was revered across the world. 
The most feared of his troops were known as 'berserkers' and they helped King Harald's influence grow across the globe. 

These mighty warriors are described in on ancient poem as being "intrepid heros" who carried "bloody shields". Such was their status that they were often treated in the same manner as royalty once home from battle and it was the use of these "berserkers" invading Orkney which marked the start of the book "Orkneyinga saga".

### Comments
"Easily drinkable"

"Smooth and slightly peaty"

"The smell reminds me of vanilla and molasses" 

**Overall:** 

This is a whiskey that divides the Whiskey Nerds. 
Some of us think it's smooth and can taste all the great, complex notes. 
Some of us can't get through the spiciness and alcohol. 

Personally, I think it's great. We've tried it with a spicy beef jerky and it really compliments it perfectly.
