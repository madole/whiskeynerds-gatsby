**Glengoyne 18 Year Old** is described as:
>Released toward the end of 2012 to replace the superb Glengoyne 17, this 18 year old was aged in refill sherry and first-fill sherry casks and the results are very good indeed.

**Varietal**: Highland Scotch | **Style**: Single Malt | **Alcohol**: 43%

####Our Rating
**Smell:** 3.5/5 | **Taste:** 4.25/5 | **Smoothness:** 4.25/5   
**Overall:** 4/5 

*Comments:* A smooth smell that doesn't have lingering hints of alcohol. A typical highland with a deep brown sugary character. A beautiful dark golden color. Incredibly smooth. You could drink this on a long sexy evening. Just don't try opening it up with water because the magic will vanish.
