###About the Distillery
In the small village of Bushmills, settled on the banks of the river you'll find the oldest working distillery in Ireland. A place where family and friends have worked for generations, in a small Northern Irish village that for over 400 years has kept to the philosophy that hand crafting small batches is the way to produce beautifully smooth tasting Irish whiskey.

###About the Whiskey
A special release to celebrate the distillery's 400th anniversary in 2008, this whiskey is a rarity we were glad to get our hands on.

###Our Take
We were eager to try this rare and possibly overpriced item and what we found was a decent blend, strong and intense with a sweet comforting aroma. A little bit of fiery caramel in it. Hefty. 

Had we been doing a blind tasting we would've thought this is a single malt.
