####Our Rating
**Smell:** 2.75/5 | **Taste:** 2.75/5 | **Smoothness:** 3.5/5   
**Overall:** 3/5 

*Comments:* A zingy smell with understated hint of fruitiness and vanilla. Little bit of heat on the tongue with each sip but it doesn't follow its way down. The taste is really light, with a subtle sweetness. A great middle range whiskey which we highly recommend for a casual whiskey drinking session.
