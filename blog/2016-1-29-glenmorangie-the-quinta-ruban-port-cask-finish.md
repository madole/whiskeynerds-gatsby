The darkest and most intense whisky in the extra-matured range, **Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban** has spent 10 years maturing in American white oak casks, before being transferred into specially selected ruby port pipes from the Quintas or wine estates of Portugal.

Extra maturation in these port pipes develops Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban into a voluptuous spirit with a complex balance of sweet and dry flavours and an intriguing contrast of smooth and crisp, cooling textures. Non chill-filtered for additional aroma and mouthfeel.

#### What they say:

**Aroma**: Dark mint chocolate, tangerines and Seville oranges mingle with sandalwood and walnut before giving way to a spicy finish of pepper and nutmeg.

**Taste**: Mint chocolate and walnuts envelop the palate like velvet, laying the foundations for rose, Turkish delight and sweet Seville oranges.

**Finish**: Long lasting silky aftertaste leaving dark chocolate mints and traces of orange.

#### What we say:

**Aroma**: High alcohol, hard to get the aroma coming through. Port and prunes. Dried fruit. Citrus. We can agree on the spicy finish of pepper and nutmeg.

**Taste**:
Spiciness, cinnamon. Port flavour really comes out after opening, it reveals the sweetness and fruitiness. Hints of After eights.

**Finish**:
Tingling tongue for a while after you sip it. Nutty finish.
