> "100% Blended Malt Scotch Whisky"

The award winning Famous Grouse Blended Malt Scotch Whisky 18 years old is created from the finest single malt whiskies including The Macallan and Highland park, which are left undisturbed for a minimum of 18 years. Only then are they brought together and married in cask, allowing the whiskies extra time to blend together to create an exceptionally smooth and rounded character. 


>History
>---
>Matthew Gloag was a grocer and wine merchant in Perth, Scotland. Gloag purchased whiskies from distilleries around Scotland, and when Queen Victoria visited Perth in 1842, he was invited to supply the wines for the royal banquet.

>In 1860, his son, William Gloag, took over the company and began producing blended whiskies. In 1896, William's nephew, also named Matthew after his grandfather, took over the company. He created The Grouse Brand blend in 1896, which due to its popularity, was renamed "The Famous Grouse" in 1905. Matthew Gloag's daughter Phillippa first designed the label's grouse icon.

>In 1970, Matthew Gloag & Son, owned by the Gloag family, was sold to Highland Distillers, after the death of the chairman, Matthew Frederick Gloag. The marketing and distributive power of the company saw Famous Grouse become the highest selling Scotch in Scotland by 1980 and the second highest selling in the United Kingdom. From the 1980s the brand began to be exported overseas, where it now sells over 2 million cases annually. In 1984 The Famous Grouse was awarded the Royal Warrant.

### Overall

This is a nice whisky, but it's not very complex. If simplicity is your bag, this is a whisky for you. 

If you're new to whiskey, this is a really good whiskey to start with. Very smooth, very sweet, very easy to drink.
