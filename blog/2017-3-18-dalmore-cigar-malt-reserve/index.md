**FROM THEIR SITE**

This specially crafted whisky has been expertly made to be the perfect accompaniment to the finest of cigars.

Matured initially in American white oak ex-bourbon casks and 30 year old Matusalem oloroso sherry butts, it is then finessed in premier cru Cabernet Sauvignon wine barriques.

###Our Take

While we do wish we could've had this one with some cigars, the whiskey by itself is still a well rounded candidate. From the elegant magnetic hinged box to the beautiful red hue of the blend, it didn't disappoint, delivering a solid eight in all categories.

**NOSE**: A sweet aroma that reminds us of dried fruits, christmas cake, burnt sugar and molasses it definitely shows the sweetness of those bourbon, sherry and wine barrels.

**PALATE**: A robust flavour that doesn't strike too sweet for the smell. Smooth and pleasant. Not overpowering. Like a good conversation.

**FINISH**: An extra long finish that lingers and would mix deliciously with that cigar you've been keeping for a special occasion.
