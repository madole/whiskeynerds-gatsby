The longer maturation of Ballantine's 17 Year Old gives an extra depth of flavour and character to the blend. Characterised by a subtle sensation of smokiness that differentiate it from Ballantine's 12. Its fruitiness and velvety texture coming from fresh fruits differs from Ballantine's 21 dry fruits influence.

AWARDED: '**SCOTCH WHISKY OF THE YEAR**' & '**THIRD FINEST WHISKY IN THE WORLD**' - _Jim Murray's Whisky Bible 2013_

> “Blends are seen by many as the poor relations to single malts. Ballantine’s 17 proves, quite spectacularly, what many of us have known for a great many years: it isn’t. A blender has the chance to create something unique and quite beautiful by putting together many whisky styles. With Ballantine’s 17, the blender has done his job in glorious, quite majestic fashion.” - _Jim Murray, Whisky Bible_

Tasting note: Impressive, bright deep, gold colour. The nose offers powerful sweet grainy scents, beautifully integrated with cocoa, charry vanillan oak and a very soft, gently wafting sweet peat adding depth. There’s a subtle grapiness too. Concentrated and mouth filling by blended standards and quite spicy, the palate is pristinely clean offering rich sweet malt, followed by cocoa and some smoky, honeyed, biscuit flavours. Outstanding length. Remains spicy, becoming dry - the after taste is a remarkable quality of this whisky - pulsing for a good 10-20 seconds and beyond. A top blend with plenty of character.

_Comments:_
A very soft smell, almost as if it's not alcoholic. A delicious, fruity taste. Not a really lingering taste. Very drinkable without even a drop of water. We're having trouble believing the 43% alcohol content, it's so light.

Note: We have to mention the amazing whiskey buying experience at [Vintage Cellars](https://www.vintagecellars.com.au/), Sydney. We had a full on tasting experience and the knowledge of the staff member was fantastic! If you're close by, definitely drop in and experience it for yourself.
