This 18 Year Old expression of Laphroaig is made in limited quantities each year and savoured by a fortunate few. A soft, sweet and spicy Islay peat smoke greets you when you first open the bottle. The immediate taste is an oak sweetness, from 18 years in the barrel. A faint hint of the sea can be detected, testimony to its time maturing on the remote island of Islay.

It is bottled at 48% ABV and is non-chill filtered for a depth of taste and texture.

**COLOUR**: Bright Gold

**NOSE**: At bottling strength, a soft toffee sweet but faintly spicy flavour counterbalances the trace of delicate phenols and fruit. An all encompassing smoothness brings these together. A touch of water allows the seaweed and salt to come through but not enough to overpower the vanilla and honey sweetness with just a trace of new mown hay and peat at the finish.

**BODY**: An intense depth that is exceptionally balanced and warming.

**PALATE**: An instant warming tang of smoke fades into smooth floral scents, which blends seamlessly into an oaky nuttiness and leaves a lasting sweetness on the taste. With a touch of water, the peaty warmth fills the mouth but does not overshadow the sweet chocolate smoothness. This is balanced by the rich toffee taste and slowly fades into a delicate hint of heather and peat smoke.

**FINISH**: Full bodied, long with a luxurious oily smoothness.

### Comments
Beautiful peaty and sweet aroma.

Taste is fantastic, just the right amount of smokiness. Not overpowering balances by a subtle sweetness. 

Highly recommend this whiskey as well as it's sister whiskies both triple wood and quarter cask
