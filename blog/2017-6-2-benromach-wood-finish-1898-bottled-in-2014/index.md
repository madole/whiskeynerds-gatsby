###About the Distillery
Duncan MacCallum and F.W. Brickmann founded the Benromach Distillery Company in 1898. Duncan MacCallum had previously been working at the Glen Nevis Distillery in Campbeltown and FW Brickmann was a spirit broker in Leith, Edinburgh. Construction work started at the site of Benromach Distillery in 1898 however due to the depression in the Scotch Whisky industry in 1898 the distillery did not start producing whisky until 1900 but closed the same year due to a lack of money.

In 1911 Benromach was acquired by the London based Harvey McNair & Co who continued distilling until the onset of the First World War. After the war Benromach was acquired by Benromach Distillery Ltd and was run by this new private company until 1925. In 1938 Benromach was acquired by Associated Scottish Distilleries Ltd which later became a part of Scottish Malt Distillers Ltd. Between 1966 and 1974 the distillery was modernised and continued to run until 1983 when the distillery was officially closed.

In 1993 Gordon and MacPhail took over the site and in 1997 they started to restore the distillery to a working order. The design of the distillery was changed slightly to allow it to be operated by one man. Finally in 1998 the distillery was officially reopened by Charles, Prince of Wales and bottling of the new malt started in 2004.

At the World Whisky Awards 2014, Benromach 10 Years Old won gold in the "Best Speyside Single Malt â€“ 12 Years and Under" category.

###Our Take
This whiskey greets you with a nice sweet aroma and, by the time the last drop has been had, it delivers an incredible aroma on the glass, if you close your eyes you may see the wooden barrels all around you.

Shows a beautiful dark golden colour that already speaks for the robust flavour compounded by an extremely long peaty finish.

Definitely delightful. 
And a great alternative for the hard to find Kilchoman Madeira.
