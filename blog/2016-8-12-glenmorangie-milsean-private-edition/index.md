Glenmorangie Milsean (Scots Gaelic for ‘sweet things’ and pronounced ‘meel-shawn’) is a single malt whisky full of intense candied fruit flavours and mouth-watering sweetness. It has been created from Glenmorangie matured in ex-bourbon casks and then extra-matured in former wine casks, re-toasted for the purpose. This distinctive cask preparation replicates something of the moreish sweetshop flavours in a single malt whisky.
It is the seventh annual release in our multi-award-winning and always intriguing Private Edition range. And Glenmorangie Milsean, with its remarkable sweetshop allusions, may be the most intriguing of them all.
The whisky is presented in a unique box sporting red and white thin stripes  and continuing on the bottle, which hints at that sweetshop theme.

####Tasting notes

**Aroma:** Perfumed, sweet and spicy with hints of sugar cane, ripe fruits, sherbet lemons and fudge

**Taste:** A sweet, luscious candy-like flavour followed by a mix of tart plummy fruit, candied orange peel, cherries, and angelica.

**Finish:** Long and spicy, but always with a sweetness in the background, with flavours of ginger, brown sugar, sweet tobacco and cake mix.


We cant wait to taste this whisky and we're expecting high levels of sweetness on both th enost and tongue.
