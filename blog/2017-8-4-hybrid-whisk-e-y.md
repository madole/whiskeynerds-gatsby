###About the Distillery
Twenty Third Street Distillery is the new incarnation of a century-old landmark at Twenty Third Street, Renmark, in South Australia’s fertile Riverland. The distillery was built by Barossa firm Chateau Tanunda in 1914 to take advantage of burgeoning Riverland harvests. No expense was spared in the design and construction of this imposing building and its production plant. However, Chateau Tanunda had sunk too much into it and found itself sinking into financial ruin. This could have been disastrous for the local grape growers. They’d quickly become dependent on the distillery buying their fruit.

But beneath the gloom was opportunity. Could the growers cut out the middle man and run the distillery themselves? Around 130 fruit growers banded together to form The Renmark Growers’ Distillery Company Limited and purchase the facilties. It was the first cooperative of its kind in Australia, a great success and a huge boost to the local Riverland community.

A series of mergers and takeovers unfortunately led to a rapid decline in activity at Twenty Third Street, until it ceased all production in 2002. But the spirit lingered. Enter our new team in 2016, fuelled by fresh creative passion, Riverland heart and a taste for the future.

###Our Take
Its very light gold colour doesn’t prepare you for the full aroma, and it's such a great thing to see a decent blend coming out of Australia.

With a lot of character and really nice nose toffee, caramel, buttery finish you can certainly taste the wine influence.

It's a smooth sticky warmth with a fresh aroma.

Although the finish doesn’t have a lot going on.

All in all, lots of contrasts…
A light whiskey with growing warmth with every sip.
