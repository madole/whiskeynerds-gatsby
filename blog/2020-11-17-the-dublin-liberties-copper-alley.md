# About Dublin Liberties Distillery

The distillery is controlled by Quintessential Brands who own a range of spirits from gin to whiskey to Irish cream. Its pretty new compared to some of the classic Irish distilleries like Powers/Bushmills etc. The whiskey is made under the watchful eye of the master distiller Darryl McNally. 

# About Copper Alley

This is an award winning whiskey holding Double Gold in the International Spirit Challenge 2019, Gold in the 2019 Irish Whiskey Masters and Gold again in The Luxury Spirit Masters in 2019. Thats some pretty good going for a 10 year old Irish malt.

### So does it live up to its golden reputation? 

Well, I can absolutely say it does. Honey sweet with floral notes on the nose, that sweetness continuing through on the tongue with a nice smooth finish, it has become one of my go-to Irish whiskeys. 
Itâ€™s aged in bourbon casks and finished in 30 year old sherry casks. Coming through in the mouth are flavours like vanilla, parmaviolets, almost orange peel as well. Really delicious.

# Comments

I highly recommend trying this whiskey if you want to expand your Irish whiskey knowledge to some of the newer craft distilleries popping up in recent times. It absolutely stands up against the more established whiskies coming out of the emerald isle.
