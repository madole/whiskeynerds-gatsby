This week is a shake up to what we've been tasting recently, we're going for a classic bourbon from Knob Creek.
Aged for 9 years, this bourbon weighs in at 100 proof (50% alcohol).

**On the label**
> Deep in kentucky, Tiny knob creek spills and riles down through the hills. Like the bourbon bearing its name, theres not much of knob creek but what there is rewards your finding!

### Overall

This is a pretty solid bourbon whiskey, lots of alcohol on the nose and at first taste, but it dies down in subsequent tastes. Lots of flavour, the sweetness compliments that high alcohol content. Add ice and this is a really nice sipper.
