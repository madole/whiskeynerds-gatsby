###About the Distiller
Michel Couvreur was a Belgian producer-trader who produced wine in Burgundy from 1951 to 1978. He acquired the cellars of Molet in Bouze-l√®s-Beaune in 1956, and settled in Scotland in 1964, some years after transferring the seat of his Company in England. He studied the whiskey manufacturing process and in 1971 closed the London office and concentrated on the sale of wines in the Canadian market. In 1978 he registered his company as a whiskey distillery in Scotland and began distillation in 1986. In Edradour. Michel Couvreur was incorporated in 1990 in Old Meldrum, Aberdeenshire.

He specialized in unusual whiskeys produced using artisanal methods, such as Bere Barley, a whiskey named after a variety of low-yielding barley grown in Orkney. Unlike many independent bottlers, Michel Couvreur never specified on the labels of his bottles the distillery where each whiskey was produced. 

He considered that "90% of the quality of a whiskey comes from the barrel and only 10% of the distillation process". He used bourbon barrels, popularized since the 70s instead of sherry barrels, which were rarer and more expensive, and considered this a: "great tragedy".

He died August 17, 2013 at the age of 85 years.

###Our Take
A very stylish bottle with a waxed black cork top promises a sophisticated drink.

It shimmers beautifully with a dark and rich colour and it almost feels ominous and ancient due to the "handwritten" label.

The aroma is strong, fruity and peaty. A little of sultanas. Once the initial sting of alcohol clears out the aroma reveals a distinct sweetness. Sugary and rich. Which is a bit contrasting because the taste is not as sweet as the aroma promises, instead yielding and aged, almost dry body. Definitely wooden and generous in complexity and with lots of depth. Definitely smooth.

It finally ends with a medium finish. Not too much going on, leaving a distinct wooden taste on the palate. Almost earthy. And begging the drinker for another sip.
