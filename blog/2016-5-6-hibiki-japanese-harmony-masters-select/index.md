> “Kanzen”or complete, Hibiki is a harmonious blend of innumerous malt and grain whiskies which are meticulosly blended to create a full orchestra of flavors and aromas.
Seductive, blossoming and enigmatic, Hibiki celebrates an unrivaled art of blending, fine craftsmanship and a sense of luxury from the House of Suntory.

**Hibiki Japanese Harmony** encapsulates the harmony that exists between Japanese nature and people.

Inspired by the riches and subtleties of Japan’s 24 seasons and mastered by Suntory’s Art of Blending, Hibiki Japanese Harmony is a meticulous blend of the finest select whiskies from the House of Suntory Whisky. It is a symphony of at least 10 malt and grain whiskies, aged in five different types of casks, from Suntory’s Yamazaki, Hakushu and Chita distilleries.

This delicate blend creates a oneness unfolding a full orchestra of flavours and aromas.

The Suntory Whisky blending team is led by third-generation Master Blender and great-grandson of the founder, Shingo Torii, and fourth Chief Blender Shinji Fukuyo.

### Comments
"Not a complex smell, very alcoholic"

"The smell of the cork is incredible, infact, it's one of my favourite corks ever"

"Mixed with a bit of air it's quite a spicy little number"

"Its not quite as good as the 12 Year Old, but similar to the 17"

"Opening it up tones down the spiciness and allows the flavours to come through" 

**Overall:** 

An interesting complex whisky. Very spicy flavours which adds to that trademark whisky burn. 
I'd recommend the 12 year old Hibiki over this one but overall not a bad whisky.
