>In early 1892 work began to convert an 18th-century mansion (Balvenie New House) into a distillery. The building took fifteen months to complete, and on 1 May 1893, the first distillation took place at the Balvenie Distillery.

>In 2007, The Balvenie's Global Brand Ambassador, David Mair presented an online documentary series about the making of malt whisky, shot in and around the Balvenie Distillery.

>Balvenie Caribbean Cask was created by The Balvenie Malt Master, David Stewart, who celebrated an incredible 50th anniversary at the distillery in 2012. This single malt has had a 14-year maturation period in traditional oak whisky casks, before being transferred to casks that previously held Caribbean rum to finish aging.

### Previous Tasting:

**Smell:** 3/5 | **Taste:** 4/5 | **Smoothness:** 4/5 | 
**Overall:** 3.75/5

Comments: Very smooth without even a hint of a burn on the first sip. Easy to drink. What it lacks in smell, it more than makes up for in taste.
