###About the Distillery
Auchentoshan distillery (/ɒxənˈtɒʃən/ awkh-ən-TAW-shən) is a Single Malt whisky distillery in the west of Scotland. The name Auchentoshan is from Gaelic Achadh an t-Oisein and translates as "the field of the corner". The distillery is also known as "Glasgow's Malt Whisky" due to its close proximity to Glasgow and "the breakfast whisky" due to its sweet and delicate nature. Auchentoshan is located at the foot of the Kilpatrick hills on the outskirts of Clydebank in West Dunbartonshire near the Erskine Bridge. It is one of six malt whisky distilleries in the Scottish Lowlands along with Bladnoch, Glenkinchie and recently Daftmill Distillery, Annandale Distillery and Ailsa Bay Distillery.

Auchentoshan was built in 1800. After its foundation, it changed hands multiple times, and was bought by Eadie Cairns in 1969, who rebuilt it completely. Cairns sold Auchentoshan to Morrison Bowmore distillers in 1984. Suntory invested in Morrison Bowmore in 1989. In 1994, they acquired 100% of its holdings. In May 2014, Beam Inc. and Suntory Holdings Limited merged to create Beam Suntory Inc, who are now the owners of Auchentoshan and other Morrison Bowmore holdings.

###Our Take
A big contrast with last week's colour and flavour Springwood is a young whiskey that feels lighter than the average.

It greets with a soft, clean citrus/pineapple aroma, and the first sip goes down with a slight burn. Not a lot of complexity in the flavour but it is distinct, almost earthy.

A short finish. If this whiskey was in the music scale it would be a light treble rather than a strong bass.
