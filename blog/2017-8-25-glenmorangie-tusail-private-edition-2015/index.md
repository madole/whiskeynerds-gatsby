###From the Distiller
The 6th release from Glenmorangie's award-winning Private Edition, Tùsail is the product of a carefully-selected parcel of Maris Otter barley, floor-malted by hand using traditional techniques, and non chill-filtered.

A rich winter variety of barley first introduced in 1965, Maris Otter was bred specifically to meet the demand for a high quality brewing malt and recognized for its ability to impart rich, rustic malty flavours. Now used only by a select few who continue, like Glenmorangie, to uphold an ethos of sacrificing yield for quality by using only the finest ingredients, the result is a whisky celebrating the variety’s renowned taste profile.

###Our Take
Having tried and enjoyed two Private Edition's previously, the expectations were set high for this tasting. And while the whiskey was pleasant, it was no match for the Milsean or the Bacalta. Not that it matters much since this bottle was found by chance and would be hard to get again.

With a light colour but a strong aroma, this whiskey hits the nose initially with a very boozy punch, but reveals a nice soft and sweet aroma after a moment's rest. 

The taste is sweet, bold and smooth. Earthy and grainy. Delicious on the long run but without a very complex character.

The finish is short and simple. A bit spicy on the lips and a light tingle.

A few of us were disappointed due to the high bar that other private editions set but we must remember that chronologically, this one is the predecessor and we are really happy that Glenmorangie has made the effort to continue their experiments and will be looking forward to next year's edition.
