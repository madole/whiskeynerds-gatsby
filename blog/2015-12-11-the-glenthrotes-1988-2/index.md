**Glenrothes 1988 (bottled 2014)** is described as:
>A 1988 vintage single malt Scotch whisky from the Glenrothes distillery in Speyside. Matured in a mixture of Spanish Sherry oak and American oak casks, this whisky has developed a great deal of character, with a vibrant core of candied citrus peels, supported by rich, sweet fruits and oak-y warmth. Wonderful single malt from Glenrothes - an excellent late evening dram.

Character Notes: Rich candid orange peel, fruit compot

**Varietal**: Speyside Scotch | **Style**: Single Malt | **Alcohol**: 43%

####Our Rating
**Smell:** 3.5/5 | **Taste:** 4/5 | **Finish:** 4.25/5   
**Overall:** 4/5 

*Comments:* 

Caveat: We chose this as a high end bottle to celebrate end of the year at our club. Expectations may be tied to the steep price tag.

The presentation is a little humble for the $600 price tag.
"Incredibly subtle smell."

"Spices and christmas hints. Not strong alcohol in the nose."

"The flavor is single-tracked but not a bad thing. Lovely bold citrus flavour." 

"Not overly complex. Even after opening it with water. Full bodied."

"Tingly tongue, nice coating at the top of the palate."

"Creamy. Slight numbing of the lips." 

"Not too much going on but incredibly pleasant and easy to drink."

"The redeeming feature is the smoothness. Certainly a whiskey to drink through a night of good conversation"

"Tastes like I can't afford it" - Marley.
