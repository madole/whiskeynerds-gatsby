Not much description to go along with this one. 

Distilled in 1996, Bottled in 2008. This is a 12 year old whiskey with an 8 year vintage. 

An elegant sophisticated speyside with the most complex aroma of any malt. 

Astonishingly fragrant with sweetish notes and a smoky maltiness on the finish


#### About the distillery:

> Cragganmore is a Scotch whisky distillery situated in the village of Ballindalloch in Banffshire, Scotland.

> The distillery was founded in 1869 by John Smith on land leased from Sir George Macpherson-Grant. The site was chosen by Smith both for its proximity to the waters of the Craggan burn and because it was close to the Strathspey Railway. Smith was an experienced distiller, having already been manager of the Macallan, Glenlivet, Glenfarclas and Wishaw distilleries.

> The Strathspey Railway is now disused and forms the Speyside Way long-distance walking route.

> Cragganmore is marketed by United Distillers under their Classic Malts brand.
