###About the Distiller

###Our Take

**Sight:**
Very light - lighter than most Laphroaigs.  Pale, but smokey.

**Aroma:** 
Very "Laphroaigy" but not as 'in-your-face' as their usual selections.

**Flavour:** 
Peaty, of course, but smoother than most Laphroaigs. Definitely one of the lightest, easiest drinking Laphroaigs.  Smooth, but smokey.

**Finish:** 
A light finish, doesn't linger long on the tongue though, but doesn't leave you with rank fire place breath either.

**Thoughts:**
We generally love a Laphroaig, this one a big lighter than usual for people who aren't usually into the in-your-faceness of Laphroaig.
