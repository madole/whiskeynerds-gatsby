###Our Take
This was a "bonus" bottle we picked up after catching on to the hype that the media has recently unleashed around this dram in particular. And while it's definitely a good bottle for the measly $35 AUD that it cost, we couldn't help but compare it against other Whiskeys we've had rather than place our expectations on a price bracket. So, here is what we found...

It presents itself with an very dark colour reminiscent of a JW black.

Definitely boozy on the nose, ethanol heavy even after it's been sitting for a while, but after one gets over the initial blast, it's surprisingly easy to drink.

Smooth, not a lot of complexity on the flavour department but rather a constant but mildly pleasant experience.

The finish is nothing special as it's almost inexistent. 

This whiskey is definitely all about the value since a person can get four bottles of it instead of a single great one. So, it's a great choice for those who aren't very picky and want to enjoy with friends and even good to mix without shedding tears over it.
