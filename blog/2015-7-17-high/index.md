The Highland style of Whisky is generally considered to be one of the most approachable styles. Deep gold in colour with a nose of heather and wood smoke Highland Park has a deceptively complex palate that ranges from sweet maltiness to smokey peat and savoury spices.


**Varietal:** Scotch | **Style:** Single Malt | **Alcohol:** 40.0%

**Taste:** 3.5/5 | **Smell:** 4.5/5 | **Smoothness:** 4/5 | 
**Overall:** 4/5



Comments: On the box, it boasts "Gently smokey but surprisingly sweet" and it definitely doesn't disappoint. You can smell a light peat mixed with the sweet floral aroma. It's surprisingly smooth given it's peatedness. Overall, a great Whisky.
