**FROM THE BOTTLE**

This special Laphroaig is crafted from carefully selected casks from each of our key styles, stretching back in time - with one notable addition. The heart of the spirit is drawn from a final maturation in new American Oak casks rarely used for Scotch Whisky maturation. Six months of this maturation takes place in the highest, warmest, reaches of our warehouses during the Scottish summer.

With spirit selected by our master distiller from Quarter Cask, our PX Cask and Triple Wood (European Oak casks), it represents a subtle blending of peat, oak and sweetness.

Bottled at natural colour, the result is an exquisite Laphroaig with our trademark 'peat reek' matched by an additional layer of complexity and depth brought about by the fusion of the maturation styles and different oaks, which we hope will surprise and delight you.
