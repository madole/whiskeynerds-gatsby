Laphroaig Triple Wood has enjoyed a triple maturation in 3 types of cask. The first maturation in American oak, ex-bourbon barrels, and then transferred into small 19th century style Quarter Casks for a second maturation. The final maturation is in specially selected, large European oak, Oloroso sherry casks. The result is a wonderfully rich and powerful Islay single malt.

Their signature 16 year old malt has a strong peat, smoke and seaweed nose that is followed by a nutty complexity and light fruitiness.

Glenmorangie 18 Year Old Scotch Whisky slips like silk over the tongue with a full, rounded flavour, starting with grapefruit & orange. The palate is then entranced with an accord of melting honey, creamy malt and aromatic florals that segue into the warm, syrupy nuttiness of hazelnuts and walnuts from the Oloroso sherry casks in which the whisky is matured.
